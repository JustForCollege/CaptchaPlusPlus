# CaptchaPlusPlus

A Captcha Generator written in C++ using Raylib, entierly from scratch even the GUI elements.
It works on desktop and Web (via WASM), on mobile it looks nice, however I am facing some difficulties to get the desktop web version,
to scale right with raylib, but a simple fix for now is bassicly zooming in little.
